    <h2>Saturn :-</h2>

    <h3>Saturn is a gas giant planet with rings and moons. It's the second largest planet in our solar system, after Jupiter. 
        Appearance 
        Saturn is pale yellow in color.
        It has a magnetic field, though weaker than Earth's.
        It's windy.
        Rings 
        Saturn has seven named rings: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.
        The rings are made of ice, rock, and dust.
        The rings are not solid.
        The rings have their own atmosphere made of oxygen gas.
        Moons
        Saturn has more moons than any other planet in our solar system. 
        The largest moon is Titan, which is larger than Mercury. 
        Other moons include Enceladus, Pan, Atlas, Iapetus, Prometheus, and Pandora. 
        Orbit 
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun.
        It takes about 29.5 years to orbit the Sun.
        Composition
        Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium. 
        It's thought to have a rocky core surrounded by a layer of metallic hydrogen. 
        History 
        Galileo Galilei was the first to observe Saturn with a telescope in 1610.</h3>

    <h2>Mercury :-</h2>

    <h3>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the one closest to the sun. It's a rocky planet with a rough surface, no atmosphere, and no moon. 
        Features
        Size: Slightly larger than Earth's Moon 
        Surface: Covered in craters and ridges, and a thick layer of dust 
        Orbit: Elliptical, taking Mercury as close as 29 million miles (47 million km) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million km) from the sun 
        Rotation: A solar day on Mercury is 59 days
        Orbiting period: Mercury orbits the sun every 88 Earth days 
        Speed: Travels through space at nearly 112,000 mph (180,000 km/h), faster than any other planet 
        Magnetic field: Has a magnetic field that interacts with the solar wind to create magnetic tornadoes 
        Atmosphere
        Mercury doesn't have an atmosphere, so it's a silent world without any sound 
        There is water in permanently shadowed craters near Mercury's poles, but it's all in the form of ice 
        Name
        Mercury is named after the Roman messenger for the gods, who was known for his speed and swiftness. </h3>

    <h2>Neptune :-</h2>

    <h3>Neptune is a gas giant planet that is the farthest planet from the sun in our solar system. It is very cold, windy, and dark. Neptune is similar to Uranus, and both planets have a blue color due to methane in their atmospheres. 
        Features
        Distance from the sun: Neptune is more than 30 times farther from the sun than Earth. 
        Temperature: Neptune's surface temperature is about −201°C (−331 °F). 
        Atmosphere: Neptune's atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. 
        Moons: Neptune has 16 known moons, including Triton, which is the largest. 
        Rings: Neptune has six rings, but they are hard to see. 
        Winds: Neptune has the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of 1,300 miles per hour (2,100 km/h). 
        Other facts
        Neptune has spots on its surface that are similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. 
        Neptune's moon Larissa has an elliptical and unpredictable orbit. 
        Neptune's moons may be fragments of the original bodies that formed with Neptune. 
        Neptune's internal energy is strong enough to create its fast winds. </h3>
